steps:
# Skip formal testing of merchant api because unable to workaround permission issues
# With initializing the embedded postgres db e.g. on windows as 'VssAdministrator'

# We therefore download and extract the embedded postgres (which is by far the most time consuming
# step). But initdb is deferred until the first ever run of merchant api

# The skipping of initdb is done via the SDK_SKIP_POSTGRES_INIT=1
